# StreamBet

Hello this is StreamBet. StreamBet is in the works of being a Streamer Betting Site. On this site you can bet on a streamers game if they are going to win or lose. 

For example you can bet 100 coins on Ninja that he will win the next game on Fortnite with 10+ kills. Ninja wins and have 15 kills. You win the bet and your balance have been updated from that game. Before the next game starts you can make another bet. 

You can see how it looks like at the moment here: https://joel28.github.io/StreamBet/index.html#howtoplay

If anyone have some ideas that can improve the site, message me. At the moment Im working on how i can get the API from Fortnite player stats so when the streamer has won a game with 10+ kills the one who bet won.
